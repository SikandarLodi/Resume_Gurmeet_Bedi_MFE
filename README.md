# Resume_Gurmeet_Bedi_MFE
MFE Quant Resume

This is a quick resume management repository which syncs code from my Overleaf project, while ensuring I can manage and track past changes

Credits for the original latex doc go to the following people, from the preamble.
It was originally a one-file resume doc, which I have extended to have multiple versions targeting different roles, and switchable quickly by commenting/uncommenting lines in the main.tex file.

Hopefully this gets scanned by ATS allowing me more incoming communication about suitable roles. Please feel free to conact at phone/email mentioned in the docs.
